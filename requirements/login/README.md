## Introduction

This document outlines the detailed requirements for designing and implementing a robust and scalable login screen. The login interface will provide users with authentication options using both a local database and an external API.

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Input Fields

#### FR1.1: Username/Email Field
  - MUST accept either a username or an email address as a unique identifier.
  - MUST NOT accept special characters to mitigate security risks (XSS, SQL Injection).

#### FR1.2: Password Field
  - MUST provide an input field for password.
  - MUST mask characters as they are entered.
  - SHOULD have an option to toggle visibility of the password.

### FR2: Action Buttons and Links

#### FR2.1: Login Button
  - MUST initiate the authentication process when clicked.
  - MUST be disabled if mandatory fields are empty or contain invalid inputs.

#### FR2.2: Forgot Password Link
  - MUST redirect the user to a password recovery page.

#### FR2.3: Create Account Link
  - MUST redirect the user to the registration page.

### FR3: Client-Side Validations

#### FR3.1: Email Format Validation
  - MUST validate the email address against a standard format if the user opts to use an email for login.

#### FR3.2: Password Length
  - MUST validate that the password adheres to the minimum length policy (e.g., 8 characters).


### FR4: Database Authentication

#### FR4.1: Database Query
  - MUST query the local database to validate the entered username and password.

#### FR4.2: SQL Injection Protection
  - MUST implement security measures against SQL Injection attacks.

### FR5: API Authentication

#### FR5.1: API Data Transmission
  - MUST transmit the form data securely to an authenticated API.

#### FR5.2: API Response Handling
  - MUST handle API responses to determine the authentication result.

### FR6: User Feedback

#### FR6.1: Error Messages
  - MUST display meaningful and clear error messages upon authentication failure.

#### FR6.2: Loading Indicator
  - SHOULD display a loading indicator during the verification process.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance

- The authentication process MUST complete within 2 seconds under normal network conditions.

### NFR2: Scalability

- The system MUST be able to support at least 1000 concurrent users.

### NFR3: Security

#### NFR3.1: Password Storage
  - MUST utilize hashing and salting techniques for storing passwords.

#### NFR3.2: Secure Transactions
  - MUST use HTTPS for encrypting data transactions.

### NFR4: Usability

#### NFR4.1: Intuitive Design
  - MUST have an intuitive user interface design.

#### NFR4.2: Browser Compatibility
  - MUST be compatible with most commonly used modern web browsers.

### NFR5: Availability

- The authentication service MUST maintain 99.9% uptime.

### NFR6: Maintainability

#### NFR6.1: Code Documentation
  - MUST have well-documented code for authentication-related components.

#### NFR6.2: Extensibility
  - MUST be designed in a way that allows easy integration of additional authentication methods in the future.
